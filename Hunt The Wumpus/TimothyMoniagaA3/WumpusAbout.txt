~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Silven Valley a peaceful area until the Wumpus arrived and settled in the nearby 
caverns. The Wumpus, a dangerous creature that has no one has ever seen this creature
and lived to tell the tail. Your mission,for fame and fortune, is to find and slay 
the creature.

You must traverse these dangerous caverns fighting off other monsters while searching
for the sleeping Wumpus. You have to sneak up on him while he is sleeping if you run 
into him you are as good as gone. 

Each location will have a brief description and up to 3 different directions that you 
will be able to travel to. To travel to an adjacent room enter one LETTER of the 
direction you wish to travel to (N,E,S,W,NE,NW,SE,SW). New information about the 
room you have traveled to will appear and you repeat the process until you have 
found the Wumpus.

In the caverns there are multiple dangers: endless pits, superbats, sneaky goblins, 
ghosts, fallen angels, bandits and of course the Wumpus. 

The Wumpus is not so lazy this time of year and every couple of turns he will move
to a random adjacent cave. The Bandit wanders around the cave aimlessly but is 
completely deaf and cannot hear your arrows. Super bats are really strong and will
take you to a random location in the caverns. Sneaky goblins are silent and will steal
your stuff and take you to a random location. Ghosts and fallen angels are a bit nicer
just make sure to get on their good side, they will gove you rewards if you encounter them

To win you must kill the Wumpus before your lantern oil or arrows run out.
At the end of the game there is a score given where the maximum without recieving any 
rewards is 1000.

Difficulty increases number of hazards and characters, reduces starting arrow 
and lantern oil.
