                                     Ghost Story
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I was an adventurer just like you traversing these caves hunting the infamous Wumpus
for fame and fortune. I came here originally with a group of friends. However, we 
encountered a goblin gang that robbed us of our lantern oil and arrows. Desperate, 
everyone ran toward the exit. But one of my closest friends tripped just before the 
exit. Only I stopped to help him get back up. When I did he pulled me toward the 
ground propelling himself toward the exit, essentially betraying and dooming me.
I always wanted to get revenge but was never able to. Now I wander the very same
cavers that I was killed in helping adventurers like you. As thanks I'll give you 
this magical map where you can see the location of everyone and everything in the
caverns (press 'c' to see all locations). And I'll restore your lantern oil and 
arrows. Thank you for listening to me.
