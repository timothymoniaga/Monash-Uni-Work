My uni work that I think is good

## Hunt the Wumpus 
A text based game base on C++ it has a use of a manual made hashmap as I did not know what a hashmap was when developing this basic game.

## Super Mario Game
A text based game based on OOP Java that is just a basic game about super mario. The documentation for playing the game is not good. All of the engine was not written by me at all and only certain parts of the game file are written by me. However, this was a group assignment and I understand all the code and coding principles such as SOLID. It is also primarily a showcase of teamwork.
